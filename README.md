### Network Requirements

- As part of **National Village Growth Programme**, the
Government on India is encouraging people located in
cities to directly contribute to one of the selected **villages**
**for upgradation** in various respects (providing tax
exemption). Residents at Park Pride Apartments & Golf
View Apartments have chosen to contribute to **Abburu**
**Village**.
- Abburu Village Panchayat is to be connected with a **file**
**sharing** network with both the apartment complexes in
Hyderabad, which would be used for sharing various
sensitive documents. Accordingly, encrypted **WAN** must
be setup such that share folders can be accessed by all
parties, without it being accessible in the public internet.
- Both the Hyderabadis and village people already have a
broadband connection, and desire a number of
automation upgrades.
- Setup Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of
each location for utilities such as **electricity** and **piped**
**gas** (where available), using existing RF-DCU, GSM/GPRS,
or WiFi based smart meters.
- Install **fire detection and alarm systems** for alerting
local people through loud sirens and contacting nearest
fire department for extinguishing, with a 5-10 min
window to prevent false alarms.
- Provide a silent **intrusion (burglar) detection system** for
alerting local security / gram panchayat, as well as
contacting nearest police department, with again a 5-10
min window for false alarms.
- Since Abburu village lies in **seismic zone 3**, a seismometer
can be installed at village center in order to **detect**
**earthquakes** and alert local people. Hyderabad lies in
seismic zone 2.
